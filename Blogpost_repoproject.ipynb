    "## Introduction\n",
    "The goal of this project was to recreate the neural network, and the results (partly) of the following paper: Estimating individual treatment effect: generalization bounds and algorithms (Uri Shalit et al.). [1] The authors of this paper aim to predict the individual treatment effect (ITE) from observational data. Therefore, the authors proposed a CFR (Counterfactual Regression) framework. In addition, the authors used a Tensorflow framework for the creating of their network. In this project we aim to reconstruct their network in pytorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that the authors of the original paper designed the code in such way that a lot of options are adjustable. For example different types of loss functions, regularisation methods, number of layers etc. In this project we choose to not experiment with all these different settings and mostly use the settings as defined in code (default settings). The only settings we changed where the choice of splitting the dataset (see section: CFR network) and the choice of the imbalance measure (see section: Correction for distribution difference)."

    "## Individual treatment effect\n",
    "The individual treatment effect (ITE) can be seen as the effect of a certain treatment for a specific patient. One can imagine that it is very useful to estimate the outcome of a given treatment before the patient receive the treatment.A doctor could then choose the treatment based on the estimated outcome. Observational data e.g. given medication is used order to make such predictions. The ITE can be calculated using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ITE (x) = E[Y_1 - Y_0 | x]$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $Y_1$ is the outcome given the treatment and $Y_0$ the outcome not given the treatment. Then the ITE of a certain treatment is then the expected outcome given the treatment minus the expected outcome not given the treatment when observing data x."

This for example: if a diabetic patient received an insuline in treatment the t value would be 1 for the insulin treatment and the y_factual would be the \"factual\" outcome, the yc_factual outcome would then be the outcome given the opposite treatment, so when no insulin was given."

Then the user can choose for splitting the data set in two subsets: a subset with all data where t = 1 (treated group), and a subset for all data with t = 0 (not treated). If the user choose to do so then the datasets will be merged again to form 1 output."

So for example if a patient has received a certain treatment let's say a patient had a surgery. Then the sample re-weighting would be 2 divided by two times the probability of being treated. If the probability of being treated is really high, close to 1, then a sample will get a relatively low weight. However, if the chance of being treated is very low then the sample would get a higher weight. The same could be observed for t = 0 (not treated). This will somewhat correct for the unequally distributed treatments groups i.e. it will correct for the fact that maybe a lot of patients received treatment A and only a few patients received treatment B."
